# Gender Bias

Gender bias is the preference or prejudice toward one gender over the other. 

This has real-world consequences; for example, concerns have been raised about automatic resume filtering systems giving preference to male applicants when the only distinguishing factor is the applicants’ gender.

### Categorization:

1. **Allocation Bias:**  economic issue in which a system unfairly allocates resources to certain groups over others. _Seen when models perform better on majority gender data._
2. **Representation Bias:** systems detract from the social identity and representation of certain group. _Seen within word embeddings and latent representations_
3. **Recognition Bias:** involves a given algorithm’s inaccuracy in recognition tasks
4. **Under-Representation Bias:** is the disproportionately low representation of a specific group.
