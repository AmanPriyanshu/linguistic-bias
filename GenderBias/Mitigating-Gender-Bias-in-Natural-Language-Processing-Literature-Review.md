2. **Representation Bias:** systems detract from the social identity and representation of certain group. _Seen within word embeddings and latent representations_
3. **Recognition Bias:** involves a given algorithm’s inaccuracy in recognition tasks
4. **Under-Representation Bias:** is the disproportionately low representation of a specific group.

Using time and accuracy as metrics for similar and different word-concept-associations) can be used as basis for tests like the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) /  Sentence Encoder Association
Test (SEAT).
2. **Analyzing Gender Sub-space in Embeddings:**
